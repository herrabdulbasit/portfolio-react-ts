            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’m a passionate Software Engineer with over 3 years of professional experience,
                specializing in Ruby on Rails, Python, React TypeScript and JavaScript, MySQL, 
                and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure. I thrive on building scalable, high-performance applications 
                and solving complex technical problems through elegant solutions. 
                Currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at FAU Erlangen, 
                I’m enhancing my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and AI. 
                My experience bridges both software development and data science, allowing me to develop 
                full-stack solutions that leverage data-driven insights. I’m deeply committed to continuous 
                learning and enjoy working with cutting-edge technologies. 
                Whether collaborating on dynamic front-end interfaces or architecting robust back-end systems, 
                I aim to deliver seamless user experiences and powerful data-driven applications.</p>
